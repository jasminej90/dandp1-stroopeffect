## 1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?
Independent variables: congruency words condition, whether the color of the ink matches the written word or not. 
Dependent variable: the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists.

## 2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.
The question I’m interested in answering is: does in-congruency (mismatching the ink color with the written word) causes significantly different reaction time to name the ink color?

To come up with my hypothesis, I will compare the following two means:
 * μC: population mean before intervention (congurent population mean)
 * μI: population mean after intervention (incongurent population mean)

**Null hypothesis H0 (μC = μI)** <br />
_In-congruency does not have an effect on the reaction time taken to name the ink color._ In other words, the population mean before intervention (congurent population mean) equals population mean after intervention (incongurent population mean).

**Alternative hypothesis Ha (μC != μI)** <br />
_In-congruency results in a significantly different reaction time taken to name the ink color._ In other words, the population mean before intervention (congurent population mean) is significantlly different from the population mean after intervention (incongurent population mean).

The statistical test I choose to perform is: Two-Tail Paired T-test
  * Paired: because the participants in the first group are the same as participants in the second group.
  * T-Test: because I have a limited sample (n < 30), and I do not know the population standard deviation.

and my alpha level is 0.05 (5%)

## 3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.

   |                Congruent | Incongruent
---               |      ---  | ---
**Mean**	         | 14.051125	  | 22.01591667
**Median**	       | 14.3565	    | 21.0175
**Variance** 	    |	12.66902907	| 23.01175704
**Standard Dev.**	| 3.559357958	| 4.797057122

## 4. Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots.

Those are two histograms of Congruent datasets with different bin sizes. The first one has a bin size of 2, while the second one has a bin size of 5. The larger bin size allowed for more frequency within every range, and it is clearer that the data is normally distributed.

When plotting an area chart of the two conditions together, it is clear that all participants took longer time in naming the incongruent dataset.

## 5. Now, perform the statistical test and report your results. What are your confidence level and your critical statistic value? Do you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it? Come to a conclusion in terms of the experiment task. Did the results match up with your expectations?

Diff column represents the difference between Congruent and Incongruent data. After performing my statistical test (T-test), I reached a T-score of about  8.0207 (in both tails, positive and negative), and my T-critical value is 2.069.

Since my T-score is significantly bigger than my T Critical Value, and p-value < 0.05, I will reject the null hypothesis with a confidence level of %95. The results match up with my expectations, as the area chart above shows that there is a significant difference between the time taken in naming congruent vs. incongruent words.

## 6. Optional: What do you think is responsible for the effects observed? Can you think of an alternative or similar task that would result in a similar effect? Some research about the problem will be helpful for thinking about these two questions!

Probably the part of the brain that is responsible for translating the ink color is different from the part responsible for reading written word. In congruent cases, no conflict is occurring which leads to a faster reading. However, in incongruent cases, the conflict results in time lag because we are activating another system in the brain that requires more effort (slower) as it has more analysis capabilities.
